- `lib/services/` - Business logic for managing notes and todos

### Models
1. **Note Model** (`lib/models/note.dart`)
   - Properties: title, content, isPinned, lastModified
   - Methods for converting to/from Map for storage

2. **Todo Model** (`lib/models/todo.dart`)
   - Properties: task, isCompleted
   - Methods for converting to/from Map for storage

### Services
1. **Note Service** (`lib/services/note_service.dart`)
   - Manages a list of notes in memory
   - Methods: getNotes(), addNote(), editNote(), togglePinStatus(), deleteNote()

2. **Todo Service** (`lib/services/todo_service.dart`)

### Screens

## Navigation Flow
1. App starts at Main Page showing Notes Home Page
2. User can switch between Notes and To-Do List using the drawer menu
3. Adding/editing notes and tasks opens dedicated pages with forms
4. Changes are saved in memory (no persistent storage implemented yet)

## Future Improvements
- Add persistent storage using SharedPreferences or SQLite
- Implement search functionality
- Add categories/tags for notes and todos
- Implement reminder notifications for tasks
- Add cloud sync capabilities
